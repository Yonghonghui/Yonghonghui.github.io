## Overview

Developed a RRAM-based heterogeneous processing system for multimodal brain-computer interfaces, focusing on P300 signal recognition and integration with other BCI modalities.

## Technical Details

- Simulated representative heterogeneous processing paradigm of P300 signal recognition using resistive random-access memory (RRAM)
- Implemented and evaluated fixed parameter disturbance training (FDT) techniques
- Combined multiple datasets:
  - BCIC IV IIa dataset
  - P300 RSVP dataset
- Designed an RRAM-based multimodal recognizer integrating:
  - Pre-trained EEGNet
  - Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)
  - Modality-fused classifier

## Results & Achievements

- Achieved 2.83% higher accuracy using multimodal BCI with FDT compared to without FDT
- Significantly outperformed single-modality approaches:
  - 8.19% improvement over MI-alone results
  - 13.20% improvement over P300-alone results
