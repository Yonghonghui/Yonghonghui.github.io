## Overview

Created an intelligent assistant for the game 2048 that combines real-time image processing with AI decision-making to analyze the game state and recommend optimal moves.

## Technical Details

- Implemented advanced image processing pipeline:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Canny edge detection
  - Perspective transformation
  - Template matching for digit recognition
- Developed AI decision engine:
  - Expecti-max Search algorithm
  - Corner placement strategy
  - Move evaluation heuristics
- Built Android application:
  - Real-time camera feed processing
  - Game state analysis
  - Move recommendation display

## Key Achievements

- 100% digit recognition accuracy with proper alignment
- Consistent AI performance reaching 1024 tile in 75% of simulations
